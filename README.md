# C Programming Lab Experiments  

This repository contains a set of C Programming lab experiments completed during our 1st-year coursework. These experiments cover fundamental programming concepts, including **input/output operations**, **decision-making constructs**, **loops**, **functions**, **arrays**, **pointers**, **structures**, and **file handling**. Each experiment is designed to strengthen problem-solving skills and provide hands-on experience with C programming.  

## Repository Structure  
- Each experiment is placed in a separate directory.  
- Includes source code, informations, and sample outputs for better understanding.
