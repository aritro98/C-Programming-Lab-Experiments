# C Programming Lab Experiments  

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of C Programming lab experiments performed during our 1st-year coursework. Each experiment is designed to reinforce fundamental programming concepts and enhance problem-solving skills. The experiments cover a wide range of topics, including:

- **Basic I/O Operations**: Understanding input and output functions in C.
- **Control Structures**: Implementing decision-making constructs such as if-else and switch statements.
- **Loops**: Utilizing for, while, and do-while loops for iterative operations.
- **Functions**: Defining and invoking user-defined functions for modular programming.
- **Arrays**: Working with single and multi-dimensional arrays.
- **Pointers**: Exploring pointer arithmetic and dynamic memory allocation.
- **Structures**: Creating and manipulating structured data types.

## Repository Structure  
- Each experiment is placed in a separate directory.  
- Includes source code, informations, and sample outputs for better understanding.
